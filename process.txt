1. Installed expo & it's dependencies through docs

Learned:
1. Stack
2. Configure nativewind (tailwindcss)
3. Splashscreen
4. Adding & using fonts
5. Tabs.Screen -> Menu bar, automatically searches for pages inside (tab) folder and add it's link in menu
6. TabsIcon
7. Tabs screenOptions
8. SafeAreaView -> ensures content is positioned correctly on all devices. Content doesn't overlap with status bar/bottom bar, etc
9. Scrollview -> makes pages scrollable
10. Touchable Opacity for btn
11. TextInput
12. FlatList -> we give data (array), keyExtractor is like map(), then renderItem
    in flatlist, we cannot do horizontal and vertical at same time so we need to use one in home and second in trending.jsx for those 2 scrolling
